<p>**0.7 Update: I have now added the ability to track Edge/Hold tokens on Advantages and Disadvantages. If the Edge/Hold box on a particular move sheet is populated with a value 0 or greater, the hold will show on the move card, as well. Also updated is automatically reducing the situational modifier to 0 after a roll occurs, and the addition of a button to output the description of moves/items to the chat box. This will output the description/trigger/special box to the chat, as appropriate.</p>

<p>**0.51 Update: I have now added buttons to lower and raise stability (to make it easier to remember which direction to go in when you take damage). I have also updated the Endure Injury move to collect the amount of harm taken when a character is injured and automatically include it in the roll). Addition of TinyMCE editor fields on the move sheet to improve the ability to edit moves.</p>

<p>Feedback is still sought on the appearance of the NPC sheet (I'm aware that it looks bad, but am not sure how people would like to see it).</p>

<p>Wound tracking now works! If any text at all is entered into a wound box (either the Serious or Critical) and the Stabilized box is set to "No", then the appropriate penalty will be applied to all rolls.****</p>

<p>You should replace the moves on your actors with the new moves from the Compendium (there have been a couple of updates). There is a known issue that the three special moves (Keep It Together, Endure Injury, and See Through the Illusion) must have their special field (at the bottom of the Item Sheet) manually set until the Compendium can be corrected.</p>**

<p>If you have feature requests or want to contribute code, please let me know.</p>
<p>Clicking on the name of a move/advantage/disadvantage on the character sheet will allow you to roll (each item has an attribute that can be manually associated with it on the item sheet). Advantages and Disadvantages can be set to either Active (able to be rolled) or Passive (not able to be rolled) based on whether or not they trigger a move.</p>
<p>The two fields at the top of the sheet are intended to add ongoing or one-time modifiers to rolls. The bonus from aiding/hindering should be added here. Penalties/Bonuses to "Keep It Together" and "See Through the Illusion" based on Stability are automatically factored in.</p>
<p>Things I know do not currently work (as of version 0.51):</p>
<ul>
<li>All kinds of visual design on the actor sheet (I'm kind of terrible at both graphic design and CSS)</li>
<li>Error checking on many fields (please let me know if you have questions about what type of data should be in each field)</li>
<li>Ammo Tracking on ranged weapons (my current solution is to use the Edit button on the weapon item to open its sheet so that the ammo can be updated)</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you so much to both siegn and michael.t.zajac for helping to clean up the code and squash bugs.</p>
